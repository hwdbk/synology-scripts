# script to interpret binary @SynoEAStream files and extract the xattr from the structure
# input:
#     get_attr [-x] [-q] attr_name file
#     prints the value of the xattr with key attr_name belonging to the file. use -x to print output in hex (useful for binary values)
#     the file parameter is either the @SynoEAStream file itself of the (mother) file to which the @SynoEAStream file belongs. if the @SynoEAStream file isn't there, you'll get an error.
#     the script assumes that the attr_name extended attribute is present in the file. if not, you'll get an error, unless called with -q (quiet).
#     a very efficient way of checking whether the attribute is present in the file is with:
#         grep -arlF <attr_name> <path> --include='*@SynoEAStream' | while read f ; do tag "$f" ; done
#     (look at the listtags script, which uses this mechanism)
# output:
#     the script prints the value of the attribute
#     if the file does not contain the attribute, the script prints nothing (with -q) or an error (without -q)
#     prints a msg on stderr when the input is not according to expectation (parse error)
# note:
#     the location of the attribute's value is not related to the location of the attribute key string itself, or so investigation revealed
#     (they are not always following each other). reverse-engineering learnt that the attribute key string is preceded by a string length byte and 10 index bytes
#     comprising of 4 bytes file offset to the value data, 4 bytes length of the value data and two bytes 0x00.
